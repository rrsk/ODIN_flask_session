ODIN Flask Session
=======

> A post session flask app to help students build their own route and

Web Developement is not that difficult especially if you learn by doing it and making stuff. To help you further we introduced Flask, a micro framework for you to make your first web page and backend routing.


 - Clone or fork this repo to your github account or locally. This might help your learn   it :  https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 OR http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners
 
 - After this if your machine doesn't have pip (python package manager), install using this:
 	
	```
	   $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
	   $ sudo easy_install pip
	```
	
	
 - Now if you remember from the session you'll need flask to run this app.
 
	`$ pip install Flask`


To run the app, change directory to where the cloned repo is located and then for linux:

    $ export FLASK_APP=app.py
    $ flask run

If you are on **Windows** you need to use **set** instead of **export**.

You all are welcome to create your own routes and render own HTML code and be a part of this project. 

Docs are always the best way to get started so here they are:  http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/#quickstart
