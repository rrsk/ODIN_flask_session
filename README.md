ODIN Flask Session
=======

> A post session flask app to help students build their own route and

Web is not that difficult especially if you learn by doing it and making stuff. To help you further we introduced Flask a micro framework for you to make your first web page and backend route.


 - Clone or fork this repo to your github account or locally. This might help your learn   it :  https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 OR http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners
 
 - After this if you machine doesn't have pip (python package manager) get it here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
 
 - Now if you remember form the session you'll need flask to run this app.
 
	`$ pip install Flask`


To run the app change directory to where the cloned repo is located and then for linux:

    $ export FLASK_APP=app.py
    $ flask run

If you are on **Windows** you need to use **set** instead of **export**.

You all are welcome to create your own routes and render own HTML code and be a part of this project.
